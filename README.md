# Be Your Chef
This is an informative cooking website, which also consist of a "contact" and "log-in" page. The inspiration comes from seeing my friends who live by themselves,
and they learned how to cook. The intention was for the users at the age of 16-65+ have an easy access to the information and recipes needed for their busy day.
I am a food-lover myself, and I started cooking and baking since I was 12. A lot of people belives that cooking only enjoyable when you have someone to cook for.
But that's not always the case. I believe we can relish with meal we make and find some peace in the time of learning.
In this website, user can read information about cooking, surf for a recipe, send us a message or create an account for yourself. Here is how the page looks like.
