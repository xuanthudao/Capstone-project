    <h2> What is cooking? </h2>
     <p>Cooking, cookery, or culinary arts is the art, science, and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption.
        Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves,
        to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions.</p><br>
    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
    <p>Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better nutrition is related to improved infant,
        child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of non-communicable
        diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity.</p>
    <p>Healthy children learn better. People with adequate nutrition are more productive and can create opportunities to
        gradually break the cycles of poverty and hunger.</p>
    <p>Malnutrition, in every form, presents significant threats to human health. Today the world faces a double burden
        of malnutrition that includes both undernutrition and overweight, especially in low- and middle-income countries.</p><br>
